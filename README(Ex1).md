This is a calculator converter from strings to any other base [2,16].
In this code you can find 5 functions and their tests that build this code.
Here is a demonstrate;

Ex1 class solution:
Enter a string as number#1 (or "quit" to end the program): 
123bC
num 1 = 123bC is number: true , value 123bC
Enter a string as number#2 (or "quit" to end the program): 
132bD
num 2 = 132bD is number: true , value 132bD
Enter a base for output: (a number [2,16]) 
4
171 + 210 = 11331b4
171 * 210 = 20301012b4
Max number over [123bC, 132bD, 11331, 20301012] is: 3
